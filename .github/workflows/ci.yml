# The root package has no cross-repo deps — only pointycastle (hosted).
# example/ depends on flutter_secure_dotenv_generator ^2.0.0 which is
# not yet on pub.dev, so its resolution warns during dart pub get.
# We use "|| true" because the root package always resolves; only the
# example causes exit 1. Once the generator is published, remove "|| true".
